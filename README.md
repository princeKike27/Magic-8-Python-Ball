# Magic-8-Python-Ball

For this project I created a python implementation of the Magic 8-Ball game. The Magic 8-Ball is a popular 
toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter 
and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, then turns 
it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball. 

The program starts by giving a welcoming message to the user. It then proceeds to asks the user for its name and the question 
he would like to know the answer of. These two inputs are saved as variables and are used to print to the interface the question
that is asked to the Magic-8-Python Ball. Then, the program chooses randomly an answer from a list of possible answers and prints
it to the user. The user is then given the possibility of asking another question, if the answer is 'Yes' the program will rerun 
and provide another random answer to the user. Instead if the answer is 'No' the program will end with printing a goodbye message 
to the interface.
