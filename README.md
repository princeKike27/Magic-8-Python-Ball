# Magic-8-Python-Ball

For this project I created a python implementation of the Magic 8-Ball game. The Magic 8-Ball is a popular 
toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter 
and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, 
then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.
