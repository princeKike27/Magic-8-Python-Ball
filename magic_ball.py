MAGIC 8-PYTHON-BALL

For this project I created a Python implementation of the *Magic 8-Ball* game. The Magic 8-Ball is a popular 
toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, 
then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter a
nd Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel.
